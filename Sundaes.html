       <p>INGREDIENTS



For the Coconut Cream Caramel:

1½ cups light brown sugar

2 tablespoons water

¾ cup (1½ sticks) unsalted butter

1 vanilla bean, seeds scraped

½ cup coconut milk

1 teaspoon kosher salt



For the Cardamom-Pistachio Brittle:

1 cup granulated sugar

For the Sichuan Peppercorn Hot Fudge:

⅓ cup dark brown sugar

</p>

<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<p>1. Make the caramel: In a medium saucepan, combine the sugar, water, butter and the vanilla bean and seeds over medium-high heat. Bring to a simmer and cook until the sugar has melted and the caramel is rapidly bubbling, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in the remaining ingredients and remove from the heat. Let cool completely, then remove and discard the vanilla bean.



2. Make the brittle: Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and grease. In a medium saucepan, whisk together the sugar, corn syrup and water over medium-high heat. Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring constantly, until the mixture is light amber in color, 5 to 6 minutes. Stir in the remaining ingredients, then immediately pour the mixture onto the prepared baking sheet into a thin layer. Let cool completely, then break the brittle into small pieces.



3. Make the compote: In a medium saucepan, combine all of the compote ingredients over medium heat. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring often, until the fruit is softened and the syrup has thickened, 7 to 8 minutes.



4. Make the hot fudge: In a medium saucepan, combine half of the chocolate with the heavy cream, corn syrup, dark brown sugar, cocoa powder, Sichuan peppercorns and kosher salt over medium heat. Bring to a simmer and cook, whisking constantly, until a thick smooth sauce forms, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and whisk in the remaining chocolate and the butter until smooth. Let steep for 5 minutes, then strain out the peppercorns.



5. Assemble the sundaes: Divide the vanilla ice cream between bowls and drizzle with the caramel and hot fudge. Scatter pieces of brittle on top and spoon the compote around the sides. Garnish with whipped cream and a maraschino cherry, then serve.</p>
